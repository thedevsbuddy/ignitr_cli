# Ignitr

Ignitr is a simple yet powerful flutter mini framework, designed to simplify the development of Flutter applications. It provides a set of tools and utilities to streamline the process of building Flutter apps, making it easier for developers to create high-quality, feature-rich applications. Ignitr is designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing developers to tailor it to their specific needs. It is highly inpired by the other `MVC` framewords built with other technologies like [Laravel](https://laravel.com) and [CodeIgniter](https://www.codeigniter.com).

### Getting Started

```shell
dart pub global activate ignitr_cli
```

- **MVC Pattern**: The project follows the `MVC` pattern, which separates logic, UI, and models for better manageability. Additionally, a new service layer has been introduced to facilitate communication with APIs.
- **Modular Structure**: The modular structure allows developers to reuse modules across different projects, offering greater flexibility and scalability.
- **Module Generator**: A simple module generator tool has been added, enabling you to generate any module with a single command.
- **Local File Database**: This project includes a local file database, allowing you to create a data file for each local service and use it to store data efficiently.

### Module Generator

Ignitr comes with the powerfull CLI tool to help you generate the modules.

#### How to use

1. `ignitr make:module <module_name>`: To generate a new module you can use this command, please make sure to use the **`singular`** name of the module.
2. `ignitr make:page <page_name> --on=<module_name>`: This command will generate a new page and associated controller inside the specified module.

#### Generate Module

```shell
ignitr make:module blog
```

_NOTE: Please make sure to use the module names as singular name_

This will generate all the files required for a `Module`

##### Generated Files Inside your project's `lib/app/modules` directory.

```txt
ðŸ“‚ blog
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ controllers
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ blog_controller.dart
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ routes

â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“„ blog_module.dart
```

#### Generate Page/View

ignitr make:page comment --on=blog
```

This will generate the new view/page (`comment_page.dart`) along with it's controller (`comment_controller.dart`) file inside the `blog` Module.
